Account Security Best Practices
*******************************

1. Use trusted devices. Hyperview recommends using only trusted business and personal devices that are up to date on security.

.. note:: For an actively used application session, a login from a **unique** user, browser and device combination can remain active for up to 15 days unless the user logs out or clears their browser cache.

2. Enforce single sign-on with Microsoft and keep a limited set of accounts that can log in with their local username and password.

3. Enable 2-factor authentication for local accounts. The application allows administrators to report on 2-factor authentication adoption in the application.

4. Use security features such as user roles and access policies to limit users to the capabilities and assets they need access to.
