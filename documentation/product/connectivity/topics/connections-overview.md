# Connections Overview

The Connections feature allows users to document A to B connectivity between assets. Users can access detailed connection information, add and edit properties efficiently, and automatically track changes to connections.

Users can improve the documentation of the physical network layer, enhance operational oversight, and streamline change and audit workflows.
