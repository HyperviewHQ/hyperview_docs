Adding a discovery will create a base record to discover assets to a specific location and use a specific Data Collector. You must subsequently update the discovery's details to specify IP addresses, protocols, and other details. If the Data Collector is retired in the future, another existing Data Collector must be assigned in its place.

1. Go to *Discoveries → Overview → Add*
2. Enter details as follows:

> - Provide a Name for the discovery
> - Specify the Data Collector that will be used
> - Specify the Location where the newly discovered assets will be added
> - Specify the Discovery Type (General, VMware, or IxOS). The default is "General"

3. Click *Create*

## Deleting a discovery

1. Go to *Discoveries → Overview*
2. Click the three dots on the discovery row → *Delete → Delete*
