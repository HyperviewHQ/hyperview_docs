Discovery reports are automatically generated for completed discoveries at *Discoveries → Overview → Details → Discovery Report*. The page includes a comprehensive list of all run records for the specific discovery.

- To look up a specific discovery report, click the corresponding *Details* button in the report grid.

Each discovery report mentions execution specifics, including error codes for Hyperview Support. You can also review a searchable list of discovered assets and their discovery status (New, Changed, or Unchanged).

:::{tip}
Double-clicking a discovered asset in the report grid opens the asset's Dashboard page. To see an asset-specific discovery report for the asset (across all existing discoveries), go to *Information → Discovery Report*.
