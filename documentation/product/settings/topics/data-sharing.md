# Data Sharing

## Catalog Data

Administrators can automatically send feedback requests to Hyperview if previously unknown model information is discovered or manually added.

This data is anonymized and aggregated by Hyperview. It will be added to the global catalog and shared with all customers once reviewed, validated, and accepted.

This setting is off by default.
