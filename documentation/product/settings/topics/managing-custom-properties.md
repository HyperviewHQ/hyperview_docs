# Managing custom properties

Custom properties are user-defined asset properties that can be applied to any number and any type of asset. Usage patterns for custom properties vary across organizations, but typically they are used to classify certain groups of assets and make them easier to find.

A custom property must belong to a custom property group. For example, you can have a "Management" custom property group for assets that belong to or are managed by particular groups.

To distinguish assets owned or operated by specific groups, you can add custom properties called "Owner", "Managed By", or "Maintained By". Finally, the custom properties themselves can have values like "Group 1", "Group 2", and so forth, corresponding to the exact level of detail needed.

You can manage custom property groups and custom properties from *Settings → Custom Properties → Groups* and *Settings → Custom Properties → Properties*, respectively.

## Adding a custom property group

1. Go to *Settings → Custom Properties → Groups*.
2. Click *Add*. Alternatively, if there are no custom property groups, click *Add new group.*
3. Provide a name for the custom property group → *Save*.

A success message will appear, and the custom property group will be listed in the grid. Repeat the steps to add additional custom property groups as needed.
