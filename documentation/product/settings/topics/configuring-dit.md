```

1.  Navigate to "C:\Users\userName\..hyperview".

:class: border-black
```

```{tip}
Create the directory if it does not already exist.
```

2.  Open the hyperview.toml file in a text editor.

```

```{tip}
Create the hyperview.toml file if it does not already exist.
```

3.  Add the client\_id, client\_secret, scope, auth\_url, token\_url,
    and instance\_url to the file.

```

**Hyperview.toml File Format:**
```{code}
client\_id = ''
client\_secret = ''
scope = 'HyperviewManagerApi'
auth\_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com/connect/authorize'
token\_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com/connect/token'
instance\_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com'
```

```{note}
The client ID and client secret are generated by Hyperview when adding
an API client via user management. See the {ref}`Managing API Clients<managing-api-clients-doc>` documentation for
steps.

Replace instanceName with your Hyperview instance URL.
```

4.  Execute the DIT tool. If the tool successfully connects to your
    Hyperview instance, then it will return a list of commands that can
    be used.
