# Configuring the Definition Import Tool (DIT)

Follow the steps below for instruction on configuring the DIT tool.

1.  Navigate to your user home directory. Typically it is "C:\Users\UserName" on Microsoft Windows and "/home/UserName" on Linux.


2. Locate the `.hyperview` directory

:class: border-black
```

```{tip}
Create the directory if it does not already exist.
```

3.  Open or create the hyperview.toml file in a text editor.

4.  Add the needed configuration options.

:class: border-black
```

**Hyperview.toml File Format:**

```{code}
client_id = ''
client_secret = ''
scope = 'HyperviewManagerApi'
auth_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com/connect/authorize'
token_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com/connect/token'
instance_url = 'https://instanceName.hyperviewhq.com'
```

```{important}
- The client ID and client secret are generated by Hyperview when adding an API client via user management.
See the {ref}`Managing API Clients<managing-api-clients-doc>` documentation for more information.

- Replace instanceName with your Hyperview instance URL.
```

4.  Execute the DIT tool. If the tool successfully connects to your Hyperview instance, then it will return a list of commands that can
    be used.
