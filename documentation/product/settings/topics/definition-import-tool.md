# Definition Import Tool

The Definition Import Tool (DIT) allows Hyperview users to import and maintain BACnet and Modbus definitions from the command line. Hyperview has a GUI for users to manage BACnet and Modbus definitions, however, in larger sites with hundreds or thousands of sensors, a command line tool makes it easier to manage the definitions in bulk.
