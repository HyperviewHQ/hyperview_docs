# Custom properties

Asset custom properties allow users to extend the range of data that is stored in Hyperview. Use cases include but are not limited to:

- Add data to link assets to a different system, such as financial systems
- Add data to give users of the application more context about the asset, such as project information
- Anything else users may need to add to improve efficiency and communication

Custom properties can be managed by navigating to the {ref}`Settings â†’ Custom Properties<Managing-custom-properties-doc>` page.

Custom properties can be updated in the following ways:

- Manual input by the user
- Import (CSV file)
- Bulk action
- Direct API interaction
