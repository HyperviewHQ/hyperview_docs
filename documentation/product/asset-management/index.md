# Asset Management

The term *asset* in a Hyperview context refers to a standalone device (such as a CRAC), or something that hosts other assets (for example, a rack). Commonly used asset types include IT equipment, facility infrastructure, containers, virtual machines, blade devices, and so on. An asset can be physical or virtual (such as a server and virtual server, respectively). It could even be an abstraction that represents a physical entity (for instance, a location that represents a data center).

As an application Hyperview is robust enough to recognize and correctly categorize any kind of asset ownership by a given organization. Provided you have the necessary {ref}`access privileges<Who-can-access-doc>`, you can manage all aspects of an asset, including its properties, child assets, components, sensors, layout, and so on.

Certain features, such as Rack Security and Document Management, are not included with the standard Hyperview license. See {ref}`Licensed features<View-license-doc>` for more information.
