# Sensor Threshold Management

Manage sensor thresholds effectively within Hyperview, ensuring users can customize alerts based on specific asset and sensor types. Enable or disable default thresholds, add new ones, and configure alarm severity and comparison conditions. Optimize the monitoring systems and enhance responsiveness to critical changes in sensor data.

```

1.  Open the Sensor Thresholds configuration page from the Settings &gt;
    Sensors &gt; Thresholds menu option.

2.  Hyperview has many default thresholds already configured. Users may
    not Edit or Delete these thresholds.

```

3.  Default thresholds can be turned on or off by toggling the Enabled
    setting for the threshold.

4.  Start adding a new Sensor Threshold by clicking the Add button.

```

5.  Choose an asset type to configure the threshold for. All supported
    asset types are available in this list.

```

6.  Choose a sensor type to setup the threshold for. This list of sensor
    types is limited based on the asset type selected.

```

7.  Define the severity of the alarm which should be escalated to the
    asset when the threshold is met.

```

8.  Select a comparison type. This allows the sensor value of the chosen
    type to be compared to either a constant static value, or a property
    from the asset.

```

Note that some sensor types do not have asset property comparison
options as there are no related asset properties to compare the value
against.

9.  Set the condition for the comparison. This is typically defined as
    the high or low threshold limit.

```

10.  Set a comparison value or select the comparison property and click
    Add to finish configuring a sensor threshold.

11.  The new threshold will appear in the sensor thresholds list.

12.  Any user defined sensor threshold options can be reconfigured by
    clicking the Edit button.

13.  User defined sensor thresholds can also be removed by clicking the
    Delete button.
