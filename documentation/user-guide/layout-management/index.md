# Layout Management

Certain asset types in Hyperview have a Layout page that allows you to interact with child data more visually:

- The **Location Layout** page can be set up to present child locations on a map, or show a floor plan layout with racks and contained assets in 2D or 3D mode. You can also add a background image, add shapes and labels, view heat maps and environmental sensors, and much more.
- The **Rack Layout** page consists of the Rack Elevation widget, the Zero U or Unplaced assets grid, and the Shelves grid.
- The **PDU/RPP Layout** page lets you view and edit breakers for the device, and connect assets to them.
- The **Rack PDU Layout** page lists device outlets and lets you connect assets to them.
